# README

Welcome to **Spaceship Shooter!** This action-packed game, built with Pygame, puts you in control of a spaceship navigating through an asteroid-filled danger zone. You can freely move up, down, left, and right. Your mission is to dodge or destroy incoming asteroids using your laser while enjoying immersive sound effects and dynamic background music. How long can you survive?

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal and type `python3 main.py` to start the game.
   
2. **Controls**:
   - **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship left/right.
   - **Up/Down Arrow**: Use the up and down arrow keys to move your up/down ship.
   - **Spacebar**: Fire your weapon to destroy incoming asteroids.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Destroy the asteroids
   - Avoid collisions with asteroids to stay alive. The game ends when your ship is destroyed.

Good luck, and enjoy your time in space!

### Future implementation:
