# README

Welcome to **Spaceship Shooter**! This classic arcade game has been recreated using Pygame, where you'll pilot a spaceship in a hostile asteroid field. Your goal is to survive as long as possible by shooting down as many asteroids you can while avoiding collisions.



## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Open your terminal and type `python3 main.py` to start the game.
   
2. **Controls**:
   - **Left/Right Arrow Keys**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move your ship left/right.
   - **Up/Down Arrow**: Use the up and down arrow keys to move your up/down ship.
   - **Spacebar**: Fire your weapon to destroy incoming asteroids.

3. **Objective**: 
   - Destroy the asteroids
   - Avoid collisions with asteroids to stay alive. The game ends when your ship is destroyed.

Good luck, and enjoy your time in space!
